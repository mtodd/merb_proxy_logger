h1. merb_proxy_logger

Injects a proxy allowing the use of custom logging libraries and settings.

h2. Getting Going

Once the Gem has been installed (see below), you will want to add the plugin
as a dependency in <code>config/init.rb</code>:

<pre><code>
  # ==== Dependencies
  
  dependency "merb_proxy_logger"
</code></pre>

TODO: document (as it gets decided)

h2. Requirements

This plugin was made with Merb 0.9.7 and above in mind and has not been tested
in other contexts. It requires certain recent changes to the bootloading
mechanism and won't work if these are not available.

h2. Install

Install gem from GitHub:

<pre><code>
  $ sudo gem install mtodd-merb_proxy_logger --source http://gems.github.com/
</code></pre>

or install from source:

<pre><code>
  $ rake install
</code></pre>
